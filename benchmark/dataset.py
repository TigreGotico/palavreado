"""
Shared keyword-intent reference corpus (palavreado vs Adapt).

This is NOT a benchmark. It is a small, hand-tuned dataset, ported verbatim
from ``ovos-adapt-pipeline-plugin`` so the two keyword parsers can be compared
on identical vocabulary and intents. It is not a representative sample of real
traffic; its accuracy numbers are an artifact of how the discriminating
sections are mixed and can be skewed to favour either engine. See
``docs/benchmark.md`` ("Reading the numbers").

Design
------
Intents are mostly **two-slot** — an ACTION keyword plus an OBJECT keyword —
so a single stray keyword does not trigger an intent on its own. OBJECT
vocabularies are domain-distinctive (``thermostat`` only ever appears in
*climate*, ``playlist`` only in *media*), which lets a domain classifier
route reliably. ACTION vocabularies are deliberately shared across domains
(``turn up`` is both a volume and a heating action), so disambiguation
depends on the object — the case that separates the engine topologies.

A handful of intents are genuinely single-trigger (``weather_query``,
``get_help``, ``navigate_to``) and stay one-slot.
